* Setup

After a clean install, get a working version of git with the following command:

#+begin_src bash
nix-shell -p git
#+end_src

After that, simply clone the repository and run the setup.sh script:

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/itrekr/home-manager ~/.config/home-manager && bash ~/.config/home-manager/setup.sh
#+end_src
